# The movie from IP Camera can play on TV player with Raspberry Pi running KODI.

## Summary
We can use TV player as Security Camera (IP Camera) monitor with Raspberry Pi running KODI.

## Network
1. TV and RPi are connected by HDMI or RCA cable.
2. RPi and IP Camera are connected by Ether or WiFi via router, or without router(with setting RPi as working router).

## Steps
1. login KODI
2. Make .strm file with just one line as rtsp URL, for example:  
```bash:IPCAM.strm
rtsp://admin:admin@192.168.1.3/11
```

3. Add the folder (which has the .strm file) on "Movie" - "Files"
4. Play the .strm file

## Delay
I've seen 2 second delay.
